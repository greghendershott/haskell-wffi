# wffi for Haskell

This is a port of [wffi], which I originally wrote in [Racket].
Recently I [ported this to Clojure][clojure-wffi] as a learning
exercise during my first week of hands-on with Clojure. This repo is a
similar learning exercise during my first few days of hands-on with
Haskell.

As I write this first version of the README, I'm totally confident
about this code. That is, I'm totally confident that it's full of
non-idiomatic, non-optimal code smells. In the spirit of
[Hacker School] I'm pushing it to a public repo, anyway, and looking
forward to getting some review and feedback from more-experienced
Haskellers.
